** Light-Music! **

This is FPGA project for Marsohod3bis (https://marsohod.org/howtostart/plata-marsokhod3) board.

Marsohod3bis uses MAX10 FPGA with embedded ADC, I should use it for capture audio.

Board + microphone should capture sound / audio and do frequency analyze in several ranges: low-pass filter (red), middle-band (green) and high frequencies (blue).

Accordingly it should light RED / GREEN / BLUE leds making sound-to-color conversion.

Let me try to do that.
